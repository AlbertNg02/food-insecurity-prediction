We will be using the ML Olympiad ZeroWasteEats dataset, which includes country, year the data was collected, loss percent and quantity, activity of the food, and the food supply stage. We aim to identify trends of factors contributing to food waste. We will conduct a comprehensive analysis using different algorithms to explore potential correlations among various attributes–varying from the process of storing food and the longevity in lifespan before being discarded–and use different visualization means to show our findings to highlight the trends we found. Our objective is to reduce food waste and promote sustainable practices for the food industries.
